# Google Play Store Release Guide

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before you can publish to Google Play, you need:

- [ ] Google Play Developer Account ($25 one-time fee)
- [ ] Expo account (free - sign up at expo.dev)
- [ ] EAS CLI installed globally
- [ ] App icon and splash screen ready
- [ ] Privacy Policy URL (required by Google Play)
- [ ] App screenshots (at least 2, recommended 4-8)
- [ ] Feature graphic (1024x500px)
- [ ] App description and promotional text

---

## Step 1: Install EAS CLI and Login

```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g eas-cli

# Or with yarn
yarn global add eas-cli

# Login to your Expo account
eas login

# Verify you're logged in
eas whoami
```

---

## Step 2: Configure Your App for Production

Your `app.json` needs a proper package name and version info. Update these fields:

```json
{
  "android": {
    "package": "com.yourcompany.whatsfordinner",  // Change this to your actual domain
    "versionCode": 1,  // Auto-increments with each build
    "permissions": []   // Only include permissions you actually need
  }
}
```

**Important:** Choose your package name carefully - it cannot be changed once published!

---

## Step 3: Build Your Production APK/AAB

Google Play requires an **Android App Bundle (.aab)** file, not an APK.

```bash
# Navigate to your mobile-app directory
cd /Users/alex_mj/workspace/amj-wip-solutions/whats-for-dinner/mobile-app

# Build for production (creates .aab file)
eas build --platform android --profile production

# This will:
# 1. Ask if you want to generate a new Android keystore (say YES for first build)
# 2. Upload your code to Expo's servers
# 3. Build your app in the cloud
# 4. Provide a download link when complete
```

**First Build Notes:**
- EAS will generate and store your Android keystore securely
- This process takes 10-20 minutes
- You'll get a link to download the .aab file when complete

---

## Step 4: Create Google Play Console Account

1. Go to https://play.google.com/console
2. Pay the $25 one-time registration fee
3. Complete your developer profile
4. Accept the Developer Distribution Agreement

---

## Step 5: Create Your App in Play Console

1. Click **"Create app"** in Play Console
2. Fill in:
   - **App name:** What's for Dinner
   - **Default language:** English (United States)
   - **App or game:** App

   - Privacy policy hosting services

- How you use it (authentication, app functionality)
- That you use Supabase for data storage
- User rights (data deletion, export)

3. Select **All countries** (or specific ones)
4. Complete any required compliance forms

---

## Step 10: Upload Your App Bundle

1. Go to **Production** â†’ **Create new release**
2. Upload the **.aab file** you downloaded from EAS
3. Add **Release notes** (what's new in this version)
4. Review and roll out

**First Release Notes Example:**

3. Click **"Start rollout to Production"**
4. Wait for Google's review (typically 1-3 days)

---

## Alternative: EAS Submit (Automated)

Instead of manually uploading, you can use EAS Submit:

```bash
# After building, submit directly to Google Play
eas submit --platform android --latest

# You'll need to provide:
# - Google Play service account key (JSON file)
# - Follow the prompts
```

**To set up auto-submit:**
1. Create a Google Service Account
2. Download the JSON key
3. Grant it access in Play Console
4. Use `eas submit` command

**Guide:** https://docs.expo.dev/submit/android/

## Future Updates

When you want to release updates:

```bash
# 1. Update version in app.json
# "version": "1.1.0"

# 2. Build new version
eas build --platform android --profile production

# 3. Submit to Play Console
# Either manually upload or use:
eas submit --platform android --latest

# The versionCode auto-increments with "autoIncrement": true in eas.json
```

---

## Testing Before Production

**Internal Testing Track:**
```bash
# Build a preview version
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Upload to Internal Testing in Play Console
# Add test users via email
# They can test before public release
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build fails
- Check that all dependencies are compatible
- Ensure app.json is valid JSON
- Review build logs in Expo dashboard

### Issue: Missing permissions
- Add required permissions to `app.json`:
```json
"android": {
  "permissions": [
    "INTERNET",
    "ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"
  ]
}
```

### Issue: Icon/Splash not showing
- Ensure icon is 1024x1024px (or higher)
- Ensure adaptive-icon.png exists
- Rebuild after changing assets

### Issue: App rejected by Google
- Most common: Missing privacy policy
- Ensure you're compliant with their policies
- Address feedback and resubmit
